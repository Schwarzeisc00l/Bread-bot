# Bread-bot
The bot that we are currently using on our server.


To use:

You will need nodejs.

Download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ if you are using Windows.


**sudo apt install nodejs** for Linux.


Create a folder, drag everything inside, extrack the node modules too. And then right click and open as command windows in Windows and open in Terminal for Linux.




Type in node index.js to start the bot.




You can automate this procces with .bat on Windows and .sh on Linux.
